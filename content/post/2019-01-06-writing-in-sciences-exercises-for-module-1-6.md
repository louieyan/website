### 1. Anti-inflammatory drugs may be protective for the occurrence of Alzheimer’s Disease.  

> Anti-inflammatory drugs may protect against Alzheimer's Diease.    

Use verb **protect** instead of adj. **protective**. And **the occurrence of** is useless, so delete it.

### 2. Clinical seizures have been estimated to occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of the neonatal population.  

> Clinical seizures occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of the newborns.   

**have been estimated to** is useless here and **neonatal population** just mean **newborns**.  

### 3. Ultimately p53 guards not only against malignant transformation but also plays roles in developmental processes as diverse as aging, differentiation, and fertility.   

> Besides preventing cancer, p53 also plays roles in aging, differentiation and fertility.  

This gives us a pattern to rewite **not only...but also**: using **besides..., also**.   
**malignant transformation** is another way to say **cancer**.   
At first, I don't know why **in developmental processes as diverse as** is deleted. But after it was deleted, I found the meaning of this sentence didn't change! **So if you are not sure whether a word need to deleted or not, you can just delete it and see how the meaning changes.**

### 4.Injuries to the brain and spinal cord have long been known to be among the most devastating and expensive of all injuries to treat medically.     

> Injuries to the brain and spinal cord are among the most devastating and expensive.

**have long been known to be** is redundant, using **are** is enough. **of all injuries to treat medically** can be deleted. 
First, **of all injuries** is repetitive. 
Second, aren't all injuries treated **medically**?

### 5. An IQ test measures an individual’s abilities to perform functions that usually fall in the domains of verbal communication, reasoning, and performance on tasks that represent motor and spatial capabilities.

> An IQ test measures verbal, reasoning or motor and spatial capabilities.  

**an indiviual's abilities to perform functions that usually fall in the domains of** besically means nothing, so delete it.  
**performance on tasks that represent...**, why not just wirte what is represented, and delete those words?  

### 6. As we can see from Figure 2, if the return kinetic energy is less than 3.2 U_p, there will be two electron trajectories associated with this kinetic energy.

> Figure 2 shows that a return kinetic energy less than 3.2 U_p yields two electron trajectories.
