<h3>This problem is <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp18/lab/lab05/#q9">lab05 Q9</a> of the above course.</h3>
<p>Here is the problem description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Define the function <code>add_trees</code>, which takes in two trees and returns a new tree where each corresponding node from the first tree is added with the node from the second tree. If a node at any particular position is present in one tree but not the other, it should be present in the new tree as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, here is my solution:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def add_trees(t1, t2):
    #if is_leaf(t1) and is_leaf(t2):
        #return tree(label(t1) + label(t2))
    #elif is_leaf(t1) and not is_leaf(t2):
        #return tree(label(t1) + label(t2), branches(t2))
    #elif is_leaf(t2) and not is_leaf(t1):
        #return tree(t2, t1)
    len_1, len_2 = len(branches(t1)), len(branches(t2))
    if len_1 == len_2:
        return tree(label(t1) + label(t2), [add_trees(b1, b2) for b1, b2 in zip(branches(t1), branches(t2))])
    elif len_1 &lt; len_2:
        branches_t1 = branches(t1) + [tree(0) for _ in range(len_2 - len_1)]
        new_t1 = tree(label(t1), branches_t1)
        return add_trees(new_t1, t2)
    else:
        return add_trees(t2, t1)</code></pre>
<p>For clarity, I delted the doctest.<br />
What you see is the second version of my solution. The first version has three more <code>if/else</code> as you can see in the comments. Let’s analyse this piece of code!</p>
<p>Please consider these four situations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If both t1 and t2 are leaves.</li>
<li>If one of the two trees is leaf but not the another.</li>
<li>Both trees are not leaves, but have the <strong>same</strong> number of branches.</li>
<li>Both trees are not leaves, but have <strong>different</strong> numbers of branches.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both situation 1 and 2 can be easily solved, see the comments of my code.<br />
Situation 3 is actually not hard too, because you have the <strong>same</strong> number of branches, so <code>zip(branches(t1), branches(t2))</code> works well. And hence you can add the roots of two trees and invoke recursive call on each pair of branches of the two trees.</p>
<div id="the-real-challenge-is-situation-4" class="section level4">
<h4>The real challenge is situation 4</h4>
<p>At first, I don’t know how to tackle this problem, so I went to lunch. I have been thinking about this problem on my way to the cafeteria. When I came back, a flash of inspiration provided the major breakthrough: <strong>If the numbers of branches are different, I can just add number 0 to that smaller tree to make these two trees have the same number of branches!</strong></p>
<p>OK, problem solved! But wait, situation 1(2) seems to be a special case of situation 3(4)! So, after I deleted the code of situation 1 and 2, I got the present version.</p>
<p>Code below is a definition of tree ADT.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def tree(label, branches=[]):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Construct a tree with the given label value and a list of branches.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    for branch in branches:
        assert is_tree(branch), &#39;branches must be trees&#39;
    return [label] + list(branches)

def label(tree):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Return the label value of a tree.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    return tree[0]

def branches(tree):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Return the list of branches of the given tree.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    return tree[1:]

def is_tree(tree):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Returns True if the given tree is a tree, and False otherwise.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    if type(tree) != list or len(tree) &lt; 1:
        return False
    for branch in branches(tree):
        if not is_tree(branch):
            return False
    return True

def is_leaf(tree):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Returns True if the given tree&#39;s list of branches is empty, and False
    otherwise.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    return not branches(tree)

def print_tree(t, indent=0):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Print a representation of this tree in which each node is
    indented by two spaces times its depth from the root.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_tree(tree(1))
    1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_tree(tree(1, [tree(2)]))
    1
      2
    &gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = tree(1, [tree(2), tree(3, [tree(4), tree(5)]), tree(6, [tree(7)])])
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_tree(numbers)
    1
      2
      3
        4
        5
      6
        7
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    print(&#39;  &#39; * indent + str(label(t)))
    for b in branches(t):
        print_tree(b, indent + 1)

def copy_tree(t):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Returns a copy of t. Only for testing purposes.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; t = tree(5)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; copy = copy_tree(t)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; t = tree(6)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_tree(copy)
    5
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    return tree(label(t), [copy_tree(b) for b in branches(t)])</code></pre>
