<h3 id="1-anti-inflammatory-drugs-may-be-protective-for-the-occurrence-of-alzheimer-s-disease">1. Anti-inflammatory drugs may be protective for the occurrence of Alzheimer’s Disease.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Anti-inflammatory drugs may protect against Alzheimer&rsquo;s Diease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use verb <strong>protect</strong> instead of adj. <strong>protective</strong>. And <strong>the occurrence of</strong> is useless, so delete it.</p>

<h3 id="2-clinical-seizures-have-been-estimated-to-occur-in-0-5-to-2-3-of-the-neonatal-population">2. Clinical seizures have been estimated to occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of the neonatal population.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Clinical seizures occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of the newborns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>have been estimated to</strong> is useless here and <strong>neonatal population</strong> just mean <strong>newborns</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="3-ultimately-p53-guards-not-only-against-malignant-transformation-but-also-plays-roles-in-developmental-processes-as-diverse-as-aging-differentiation-and-fertility">3. Ultimately p53 guards not only against malignant transformation but also plays roles in developmental processes as diverse as aging, differentiation, and fertility.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Besides preventing cancer, p53 also plays roles in aging, differentiation and fertility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This gives us a pattern to rewite <strong>not only&hellip;but also</strong>: using <strong>besides&hellip;, also</strong>.<br />
<strong>malignant transformation</strong> is another way to say <strong>cancer</strong>.<br />
At first, I don&rsquo;t know why <strong>in developmental processes as diverse as</strong> is deleted. But after it was deleted, I found the meaning of this sentence didn&rsquo;t change! <strong>So if you are not sure whether a word need to deleted or not, you can just delete it and see how the meaning changes.</strong></p>

<h3 id="4-injuries-to-the-brain-and-spinal-cord-have-long-been-known-to-be-among-the-most-devastating-and-expensive-of-all-injuries-to-treat-medically">4.Injuries to the brain and spinal cord have long been known to be among the most devastating and expensive of all injuries to treat medically.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Injuries to the brain and spinal cord are among the most devastating and expensive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>have long been known to be</strong> is redundant, using <strong>are</strong> is enough. <strong>of all injuries to treat medically</strong> can be deleted.
First, <strong>of all injuries</strong> is repetitive.
Second, aren&rsquo;t all injuries treated <strong>medically</strong>?</p>

<h3 id="5-an-iq-test-measures-an-individual-s-abilities-to-perform-functions-that-usually-fall-in-the-domains-of-verbal-communication-reasoning-and-performance-on-tasks-that-represent-motor-and-spatial-capabilities">5. An IQ test measures an individual’s abilities to perform functions that usually fall in the domains of verbal communication, reasoning, and performance on tasks that represent motor and spatial capabilities.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>An IQ test measures verbal, reasoning or motor and spatial capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>an indiviual&rsquo;s abilities to perform functions that usually fall in the domains of</strong> besically means nothing, so delete it.<br />
<strong>performance on tasks that represent&hellip;</strong>, why not just wirte what is represented, and delete those words?</p>

<h3 id="6-as-we-can-see-from-figure-2-if-the-return-kinetic-energy-is-less-than-3-2-u-p-there-will-be-two-electron-trajectories-associated-with-this-kinetic-energy">6. As we can see from Figure 2, if the return kinetic energy is less than 3.2 U_p, there will be two electron trajectories associated with this kinetic energy.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Figure 2 shows that a return kinetic energy less than 3.2 U_p yields two electron trajectories.</p>
