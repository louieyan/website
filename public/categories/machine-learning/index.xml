      <description>From \((4.62)\) we know that\[\begin{aligned}p(\mathcal{C}_k|x) &amp;amp;= \frac{p(x|\mathcal{C}_k)p(\mathcal{C}_k)}{\sum_j p(x|\mathcal{C}_j)p(\mathcal{C}_j)} \\&amp;amp;= \frac{exp(a_k)}{\sum_j exp(a_j)}\end{aligned}\tag{1}\]Now, we should focus on the right hand of first equal sign.
Using the assumption that \(p(x|\mathcal{C}_k)\) is a normal distribution and all classes share the same covariance matrix, we have$$\begin{aligned}p(_k|x)=&amp;amp; \=&amp;amp; \=&amp;amp; \
=&amp;amp; \
=&amp;amp; \end{aligned}\[So, we have\]a_k(x) = xT{-1}_k-_kT{-1}_k + ln(p(_k)$$</description>

      <description>I will continue adding new good resources to this post. But donâ€™t get lost in them. Choose one and keep learning. After you finished one course, then choose another one.
Hope this can be helpful to you!
Github ResourcesRoadmap of DL and MLFor a newecomer to deep learning and machine learning area, facing some much courses and resources, the first question is how to choose right books and courses to begin this trip.</description>
